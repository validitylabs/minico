# minico
This is a minimal but functional ICO creates a non-ERC20 standard-compliant token. The sale is uncapped and tokens are issued at a price of 1 token per Wei. In order to not burn all received funds, replace the address `0x0` with the actual beneficiary wallet that should hold the received Ether. Since this token is not compatible to the ERC20 standard, it will not work with most tools or other smart contracts like decentralized exchanges.

**Dear SEC, FINMA et al: This 12-line smart contract is meant as an educational example only!**
